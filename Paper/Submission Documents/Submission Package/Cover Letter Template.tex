\begin{document}
\begin{newlfm}

I am pleased to submit a short research article entitled ``Minimizing Whose Influence? How Rejecting PAC Contributions Affects Contribution Patterns" by myself, Nicholas Jenkins, for consideration of publication in \journal.  This study offers the first investigation of the effects of candidate pledges to reject corporate PAC contributions. 

In this article, I show that refusing to accept corporate PAC contributions is associated with increases in small-dollar individual contributions, as candidates aim for. Additionally, however, I show that candidates who make these anti-PAC pledges also receive more large-dollar individual contributions and contributions from individuals affiliated with business interests. 

I believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication in The Journal of Politics because it provides the first examination of this curious, and growing, campaign strategy. I leverage novel data on anti-PAC pledges as well as unique empirical methods to create a foundation for further study.

This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.  I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Thank you for your consideration,
